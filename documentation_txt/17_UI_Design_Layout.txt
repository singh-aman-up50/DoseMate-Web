UI Design / Layout

1. Design objectives:
- Provide a simple, accessible interface for entering medicines and schedules.
- Minimize the number of clicks required to confirm intake.
- Ensure readability with large fonts and clear contrast for elderly users.

2. Key pages and components:
- Login / Register: Simple forms for authentication with clear error messages.
- Dashboard: Overview of today's medicines and next reminders; quick actions to confirm intake.
- Medicine List: Table or card view showing all medicines with edit/delete options.
- Add/Edit Medicine: Form to input name, dosage, instructions, and schedule.
- Reminders Page: Calendar or timeline view of upcoming reminders.
- History Page: Filterable list of intake events with export options.
- Profile Page: Manage personal details and timezone settings.

3. Layout principles:
- Responsive grid to adapt to mobile and desktop screens.
- Primary actions (Confirm Intake, Snooze) are prominent and color-coded.
- Secondary actions (Edit, Delete) are accessible but less visually dominant.

4. Accessibility considerations:
- Use semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility.
- Ensure adequate color contrast and support for large font sizes.
- Provide keyboard-accessible controls and focus outlines.

5. Interaction patterns:
- Confirmation modal for delete actions.
- Inline validation for form inputs.
- Toast notifications for brief success/error messages.

6. Visual hierarchy and UX flow:
- Dashboard shows highest-priority tasks (next 3 reminders) at top.
- A prominent "Add Medicine" CTA (call-to-action) is available across pages.
- Quick-confirm buttons appear on the dashboard to minimize friction when marking doses as taken.

7. Wireframe suggestions (textual):
- Header: App logo (DoseMate), theme toggle, profile dropdown.
- Left sidebar (desktop): Navigation links to Dashboard, Medicines, Reminders, History, Profile.
- Main area: Page-specific content (cards, forms, lists).

8. Component breakdown (React):
- `App.jsx`: top-level router and layout.
- `Dashboard.jsx`: composed of `NextRemindersCard`, `AdherenceSummary`.
- `MedicineList.jsx`: uses `Card` and `Table` components for listing.
- `AddEditMedicine.jsx`: controlled form components and schedule picker.
- `Reminders.jsx`: timeline or calendar view.

9. Styling and theme:
- Use tailwind.css (already present in project) for utility-first styling and easy responsive classes.
- Provide a light/dark theme toggle for user preference.

10. Prototype and usability testing:
- Conduct quick usability tests with 2–3 users to observe workflow friction and adjust button sizes and label clarity.
- Collect feedback on scheduling UX and edit flows.

11. Summary:
The UI design focuses on clarity, accessibility, and quick interaction to support medication adherence. The frontend structure encourages reusability and testability of components.
