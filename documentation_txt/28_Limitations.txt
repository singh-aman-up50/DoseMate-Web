Limitations

1. Scope limitations:
- External notification channels (SMS/push) are described and may be partially mocked; full integration with commercial gateways may not be implemented in the baseline version.
- Integration with pharmacy or clinical systems (EHR) is outside the project scope.

2. Functional limitations:
- Multi-user caregiver workflows are limited to basic sharing; advanced role-based controls are not fully implemented.
- Offline and background notification handling is constrained; the web app relies on active sessions or external push services for real-time alerts.

3. Performance and scalability constraints:
- The prototype was tested at small scale; the current scheduler and database configuration are not tuned for large-scale production traffic.
- There is no built-in horizontal scaling configuration for the scheduler — a central job queue or distributed scheduler would be required for robust scaling.

4. Security and compliance limitations:
- While basic security best practices are followed (hashed passwords, HTTPS), full regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA) is not claimed for this academic project.
- Audit logging for all sensitive operations is basic; more rigorous audit trails and access controls are recommended for production.

5. Testing limitations:
- Load and stress testing were minimal; the project emphasizes functional correctness rather than extensive performance testing.
- Usability testing was limited to informal sessions; formal user studies were not conducted.

6. Reliability limitations:
- In-memory scheduling approaches can lose job definitions on restart; while reconciliation fixes mitigate this, a persistent job engine is preferable for production.

7. Operational limitations:
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures are outlined but not fully automated for the demo deployment.
- Monitoring and alerting are suggested but not integrated into the demo environment.

8. Data retention and privacy limitations:
- Data retention policies are described but archival automation is not implemented; for long-term deployments, retention and anonymization strategies must be enforced.

9. Mitigation recommendations:
- Adopt a persistent message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka) or use a managed job scheduler for reliability.
- Integrate managed database services and set up automated backups.
- Extend security controls and logging to meet regulatory requirements if handling real patient data.

10. Conclusion:
These limitations identify areas where the prototype must be extended and hardened for production use, but they do not prevent the system from serving as a solid academic demonstration of medication reminder functionality.
