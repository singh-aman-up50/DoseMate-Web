Requirement Analysis

1. Purpose:
Requirement analysis converts stakeholder needs into a detailed specification the development team can implement. It distinguishes must-have features from optional capabilities and lays out acceptance criteria.

2. High-level user stories:
- As a user, I want to register and log in securely so only I can see my medicines.
- As a user, I want to add medicines with dose and schedule details so I know when to take them.
- As a user, I want to receive timely reminders so I don't miss doses.
- As a user, I want to log that I took a dose so I can track adherence.
- As a caregiver, I want to view a user's intake history with permission so I can monitor care.

3. Detailed functional requirements:
- User authentication: registration, login, password reset.
- Medicine management: add, edit, delete medicine entries with metadata (name, dosage, instructions).
- Scheduling: support daily schedules, specific days, intervals (e.g., every 8 hours), and one-time reminders.
- Reminder engine: trigger reminders at scheduled times; mark reminders as sent and delivered.
- Intake logging: record timestamped confirmations (taken, skipped, delayed), with optional notes.
- History and reports: list historical intake events with filters (date range, medicine).
- Profile management: user can edit personal details and time zone.

4. Detailed non-functional requirements:
- Security: TLS for transport, hashed passwords, role-based access.
- Performance: API response < 500ms under normal load and reasonable pagination for lists.
- Usability: Responsive UI, accessible controls for elderly users (large fonts, high contrast options).
- Reliability: Reminder scheduling must not lose events on server restart.
- Maintainability: Clean code structure, modular services, and clear documentation.

5. Data integrity and validation rules:
- Medicine name cannot be empty; dosage must be a valid numeric value with units.
- Schedule times must be valid timestamps and within user-configured timezone.
- History entries must include user id, medicine id, timestamp, and status.

6. Acceptance criteria:
- End-to-end scenario verifying that adding a medicine leads to scheduled reminders and confirmed intake is recorded.
- Unit tests for key business logic and at least one integration test for reminder scheduling.

7. External interfaces and APIs:
- REST APIs for frontend-backend interaction.
- Optional external notification APIs (e.g., push or SMS gateways) described as future work or integrated if available.

8. Error handling requirements:
- Friendly error messages for user input validation failures.
- Server-side logging for unexpected exceptions with minimal exposure to users.

9. Internationalization and timezone handling:
- System records times with timezone information; UI displays times in user's local timezone.
- Text should be easy to extend for translations in future.

10. Traceability and versioning:
- Requirements mapped to implementation tasks in documentation for grading purposes.
- API endpoints versioned to support backward compatibility for future mobile clients.
