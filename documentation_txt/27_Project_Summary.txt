Project Summary

1. Project overview:
DoseMate is a web-based medication reminder and intake tracking application designed to help users manage medicines reliably. It integrates a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend, providing scheduling, notifications, intake logging, and historical reporting.

2. Major components:
- Frontend SPA: React components, pages, and context providers for authentication and theming.
- Backend API: Spring Boot controllers, services, and repositories handling business logic and persistence.
- Database: Relational data model storing users, medicines, schedules, reminders, history, and notification logs.
- Scheduler: Component responsible for computing next-run times and triggering reminders.

3. Key functional highlights:
- Secure user registration and login.
- Medicine and schedule management with flexible recurrence patterns.
- Real-time in-app notifications via WebSocket and a pluggable notification layer.
- Intake logging with timestamped history and export capabilities.

4. Non-functional highlights:
- Focus on usability and accessibility to accommodate elderly users.
- Security measures such as hashed passwords and token-based authentication.
- Basic reliability measures including schedule reconciliation and logging.

5. Academic contributions:
- Demonstrates software engineering processes: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and documentation.
- Provides clear mapping between requirements and implemented features for ease of grading.
- Offers a basis for further research or enhancements in healthcare informatics.

6. How to run the system (brief):
- Frontend: Navigate to `frontend/`, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`.
- Backend: Navigate to `backend/`, run `mvn clean install`, then `mvn spring-boot:run`.
- Ensure backend API base URL is configured in frontend `api/axios.js` or use proxy settings for development.

7. Packaging for submission:
- Include source code, generated artifacts (build outputs), exported diagrams (UML, ER, DFD images), test reports, and sample data dumps.

8. Final status:
- Core features implemented and validated; remaining work centers on production hardening and optional integrations.
