Functional and Non-functional Requirements

1. Functional Requirements (FR):
FR-1: User Account Management
- Users must be able to register, verify, log in, and log out.
- Passwords must be stored securely (hashed).

FR-2: Medicine CRUD
- Users must be able to create, read, update, and delete medicine entries.
- Each medicine entry should include name, dosage, frequency, instructions, start date, and optional end date.

FR-3: Scheduling and Reminder Engine
- Users must be able to schedule reminders (single, recurring, by interval).
- System must store schedule configurations and trigger reminders at correct times.

FR-4: Intake Logging
- Users must be able to mark a reminder as taken, skipped, or delayed, with an optional note.
- The system must record timestamped events in history.

FR-5: History and Reporting
- Users must be able to view, filter, and export intake history for a specified date range.

FR-6: Caregiver Access (Optional Role)
- Caregivers may be allowed to view another user's medication history after explicit permission.

FR-7: Notifications
- The system must log notification delivery attempts and statuses. External delivery (SMS/push) can be documented as optional.

2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):
NFR-1: Security
- All communication must use HTTPS/TLS. Passwords must be hashed using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
- Authentication tokens should be short-lived with refresh mechanisms.

NFR-2: Performance
- API endpoints should respond in <500ms for typical queries.
- Listing history should use pagination to avoid loading large datasets at once.

NFR-3: Usability
- UI must be responsive and accessible, supporting mobile devices and larger fonts for elderly users.
- Actions such as confirming intake must be visible and accessible with minimal steps.

NFR-4: Scalability
- The architecture should allow horizontal scaling of the backend services and database as usage grows.

NFR-5: Reliability
- Reminders must be persisted and re-scheduled on server restarts; the scheduling engine should be fault-tolerant.

NFR-6: Maintainability
- Code should be modular, documented, and follow standard design patterns to ease future maintenance.

NFR-7: Privacy
- Personal health data must be protected. The system should avoid logging unnecessary sensitive fields and should provide clear data retention policies.

NFR-8: Portability
- Frontend should work across modern browsers. Backend should be deployable on common Java hosting environments.

3. Priority and Traceability:
- Required core features: FR-1, FR-2, FR-3, FR-4, NFR-1, NFR-4, NFR-5.
- Optional features: caregiver role, external notification integrations.
- Map each requirement to design documents and test cases to ensure traceability.

4. Acceptance criteria (examples):
- A user can add a medicine and see scheduled reminders appear.
- When a reminder time occurs, the system marks it as triggered and users can confirm intake; the confirmation is recorded in history.
- Security tests demonstrate that protected endpoints require valid authentication.

5. Conclusion:
This section enumerates both the features the application must provide and the quality attributes the system must satisfy. Delivering on these requirements ensures a usable, secure, and maintainable medication reminder application suitable for academic demonstration and limited real-world trials.
