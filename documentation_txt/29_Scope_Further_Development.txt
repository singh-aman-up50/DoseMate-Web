Scope for Further Development

1. Overview:
This section outlines concrete directions to evolve DoseMate from an academic prototype into a production-ready system with enhanced features, integrations, and operational robustness.

2. Notification and delivery enhancements:
- Full push notification support via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android and Web Push for browsers.
- SMS gateway integration (Twilio or similar) for users without smartphone access.
- Multi-channel notification preferences per user with delivery tracking and consolidation logic.

3. Reliability and scalability improvements:
- Move to a persistent job queue (RabbitMQ, Redis Streams, or Kafka) for durable scheduling and distributed worker processing.
- Implement horizontal scaling for the backend (stateless services behind a load balancer) and dedicate workers for reminders.
- Employ database read replicas and caching (Redis) for high-read workloads like history and reporting.

4. Security, privacy, and compliance:
- Implement role-based access control, strong authentication mechanisms (MFA), and fine-grained audit logging.
- Conduct formal security testing and threat modeling; add encryption for sensitive fields and encrypted backups.
- Plan for regulatory compliance (HIPAA/GDPR) if handling real patient data — include consent management and data minimization.

5. Feature expansions:
- Caregiver dashboards with role delegation and multi-patient views.
- Medication reconciliation and barcode scanning to simplify medicine entry.
- Support for prescription uploads and integration with pharmacy APIs.

6. Analytics and personalization:
- Adherence analytics with charts and trends; provide personalized suggestions to improve adherence.
- Machine learning to predict missed doses and proactively prompt users or caregivers.

7. Mobile and offline capabilities:
- Native mobile apps (React Native, Flutter) for richer UX, background processing, and local reminders.
- Offline-first architecture with local persistence and queued sync when connectivity returns.

8. Integrations and interoperability:
- FHIR-based API endpoints for interoperability with EHR systems.
- Export formats for clinicians (CSV, PDF) and integrations with telehealth platforms.

9. Developer experience and automation:
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, containerization, and deployment.
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) for reproducible cloud setups.
- Comprehensive monitoring with metrics, logs, and alerts integrated with Grafana/Prometheus.

10. Implementation roadmap (phased):
- Phase 1: Add push notifications and SMS support; persistent queue for scheduling.
- Phase 2: Implement caregiver features, role management, and improved audit logging.
- Phase 3: Mobile apps, offline sync, and analytics dashboards.
- Phase 4: Interoperability with EHRs and production compliance hardening.

11. Concluding note:
The scope for further development highlights realistic and prioritized steps to make DoseMate widely usable and reliable in production contexts. For an academic project, selecting a subset of these extensions can form the basis for future work or thesis projects.
