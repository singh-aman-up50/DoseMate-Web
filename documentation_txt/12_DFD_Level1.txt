Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Level 1 — High-level Processes

1. Purpose:
DFD Level 1 decomposes the main DoseMate system into major sub-processes and shows how data moves between them, data stores, and external entities.

2. Major processes:
- P1: User Management
- P2: Medicine & Schedule Management
- P3: Reminder Engine
- P4: Intake Logging & History
- P5: Reporting & Export

3. Data stores:
- D1: Users
- D2: Medicines
- D3: Schedules
- D4: IntakeHistory
- D5: NotificationLog

4. External entities and flows:
- User -> P1: Registration/Login requests
- User -> P2: Create/Edit/Delete medicine and schedule data
- P3 -> User: Triggered reminders
- P3 -> Notification Provider: External delivery requests
- User -> P4: Confirm intake actions
- User/Caregiver -> P5: Request history/report

5. Data flow summary:
- User Management (P1) reads/writes D1.
- Medicine & Schedule Management (P2) reads/writes D2 and D3.
- Reminder Engine (P3) reads D3 and writes D5 when sending reminders; it also creates Reminder instances.
- Intake Logging (P4) writes to D4 when users confirm intake; P4 may update D5 with delivery acknowledgement.
- Reporting (P5) reads D4 and D2 to produce aggregated reports.

6. Control and timing:
- P3 operates on scheduled times and runs asynchronously.
- P4 updates are event-driven, typically triggered by user actions.

7. Error and exception flows:
- On failed notification delivery, P3 writes failure details to D5 for later reconciliation.
- If schedule validation fails in P2, an error response flows back to the user.

8. Security boundary:
- All processes require authentication tokens validated by P1 or a middleware service.
- Data access is controlled by user id and access rights for caregivers.

9. Practical documentation advice:
- Include an image of DFD Level 1 in the printed documentation showing processes P1–P5, their data stores, and data flows.
- For each arrow, include a short description in the caption explaining its content (e.g., "Schedule config" or "Intake confirmation event").

10. Conclusion:
DFD Level 1 gives a functional breakdown of DoseMate's core processes and shows explicit data exchange among them, forming a blueprint for the implementation phase.
