UML Diagrams (Use Case, Class, Activity, State)

1. Use Case Diagram (textual description):
Actors:
- User (patient)
- Caregiver (optional role)
- System (scheduled tasks)

Use Cases:
- Register / Login
- Add/Edit/Delete Medicine
- Schedule Reminder
- Receive Reminder
- Confirm Intake (Taken/Skipped/Delayed)
- View History / Reports
- Manage Profile
- (Optional) Share Access with Caregiver

Use Case relationships:
- "Receive Reminder" is included in "Schedule Reminder" as a triggered action.
- "Confirm Intake" extends "Receive Reminder" for user-initiated confirmation.

2. Class Diagram (key classes and relationships):
Domain classes:
- User {id, name, email, passwordHash, timezone}
- Medicine {id, userId, name, dosage, instructions, startDate, endDate}
- Schedule {id, medicineId, pattern, timeOfDay, repeatInterval, daysOfWeek}
- Reminder {id, scheduleId, scheduledTime, status}
- IntakeHistory {id, reminderId, userId, timestamp, status, note}
- NotificationLog {id, reminderId, deliveryTime, status, channel}

Associations:
- User 1..* Medicine
- Medicine 1..* Schedule
- Schedule 1..* Reminder
- Reminder 1 -> 0..1 IntakeHistory

3. Activity Diagram (example: scheduling flow):
- Start
- User creates medicine
- User adds schedule for medicine
- System validates schedule
- System stores schedule and registers reminder with scheduler
- Scheduler triggers reminder at configured time
- System sends notification to active clients / logs notification
- User confirms intake -> System records intake in IntakeHistory
- End

4. State Diagram (example: Reminder lifecycle):
States:
- Scheduled -> Triggered -> Notified -> Confirmed/Skipped/Expired
Transitions:
- Scheduled to Triggered: when current time reaches scheduledTime
- Triggered to Notified: after delivery attempt succeeds
- Notified to Confirmed: user marks as taken
- Notified to Skipped: user marks as skipped
- Notified to Expired: no confirmation after a timeout

5. Diagram annotations and notes:
- Use Case diagrams show interactions between actors and system features; implement with clear actor boundaries.
- Class diagrams align with database tables; attributes map to columns and associations map to foreign keys.
- Activity diagrams document critical workflows (e.g., first-time setup, scheduling, intake confirmation).
- State diagrams are essential for understanding lifecycle of scheduled events and ensuring proper reconciliation logic.

6. Implementation correlation:
- The class diagram maps directly to Java entities in the backend under `model` and JPA repositories under `repository`.
- The activity flow is implemented by a combination of APIs (controllers) and a scheduler service.
- State transitions are enforced by status fields and scheduled reconciliation jobs in the service layer.

7. Tool suggestions for diagrams:
- Use draw.io, Lucidchart, or PlantUML for generating the diagrams for printing in your submission.
- PlantUML text can be added to the appendix for reproducibility.

8. Sample PlantUML snippets (brief):
- Use Case example and class skeletons can be generated using PlantUML; include them in your submission if desired.

9. Conclusion:
This document provides textual descriptions of the UML artifacts to include in the printed report. For the actual submission, include diagram images exported from a diagram tool and reference these descriptions.
