Feasibility Study

1. Purpose of feasibility study:
To evaluate whether DoseMate can be implemented within the project constraints (time, resources, technical skills) and to choose the best approach for development, deployment, and scaling.

2. Types of feasibility considered:
- Technical Feasibility
- Operational Feasibility
- Economic Feasibility
- Schedule/Time Feasibility
- Legal and Ethical Feasibility

3. Technical feasibility:
- Tools and technologies available: React for frontend, Spring Boot (Java) for backend, and a relational database (e.g., H2 for development, PostgreSQL or MySQL for production).
- Team skills: Familiarity with Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript/React, and basic SQL are sufficient.
- Existing codebase: Project repository shows both frontend and backend scaffolding, reducing implementation overhead.

4. Operational feasibility:
- Users can access via web browsers; no special hardware required.
- Day-to-day operation requires a hosting environment (cloud VM or local server) and a database service.
- Maintenance complexity is moderate, manageable for a student project with documented procedures.

5. Economic feasibility:
- Development costs: Minimal if using existing free-tier services for hosting/testing.
- Recurring costs: Optional external services (SMS, push notifications) may incur recurring fees.
- For academic submission, costs are low since minimal infrastructure is needed for demonstration.

6. Schedule feasibility:
- The project is feasible within a typical semester timeline given the current codebase scaffolding.
- Prioritize core features (auth, medicine CRUD, scheduling, intake logging) for the initial deliverable.

7. Legal and ethical feasibility:
- Collecting personal health information requires attention to privacy; for demonstration, data should be minimized and stored securely.
- For any real-world deployment, compliance with local laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) must be considered; this is outside the scope of the current project but documented as future work.

8. Risk assessment and mitigation:
- Risk: Reminder reliability — mitigate with persistent scheduling and periodic reconciliation.
- Risk: User data privacy — mitigate with hashed passwords, TLS, and minimal data retention.
- Risk: Time overruns — mitigate by scoping MVP features and using existing library components.

9. Feasibility conclusion:
DoseMate is technically and operationally feasible with low economic cost for an academic project. The existing codebase provides a strong starting point, and focusing on core functionality ensures deliverability within the available timeframe.

10. Recommendations:
- Use an in-memory database for local development (H2) and a standard RDBMS for final testing.
- Implement core features first, then integrate optional notification gateways as time allows.
- Document deployment steps and data handling policies in the final submission.
