Final Output

1. Purpose of this section:
This section presents the final observable outputs of the DoseMate system after full implementation and testing. It highlights the user-facing results, backend logs, and example data that reviewers can verify when running the system locally.

2. User-facing outputs:
- Dashboard: Shows upcoming reminders, adherence summary, and quick action buttons for confirming intake.
- Reminder notifications: In-app popups or WebSocket-driven messages displaying medicine name, dose, and action buttons.
- Medicine management pages: Lists of medicines with details such as dosage, schedule, and next-run time.
- History page: A chronological list of intake events (TAKEN/MISSED/SKIPPED) with timestamps and notes.

3. Example UI screenshots (to include in printed report):
- Dashboard showing next reminders and confirmation buttons.
- Add/Edit Medicine form with schedule picker open.
- History table filtered by date range with an export button.

4. Backend outputs and logs:
- Scheduler logs showing triggered reminders with timestamps and reminder IDs.
- Notification logs listing delivery attempts, channels, and statuses.
- Intake logs showing recorded intake events with timestamp, user id, and status.

5. Sample log excerpt:
2025-12-22T08:00:00.123Z INFO SchedulerService - Triggering reminder rmd-uuid-789 for user user-uuid-123
2025-12-22T08:00:00.456Z INFO NotificationSender - Delivered reminder rmd-uuid-789 via WEBSOCKET
2025-12-22T08:01:02.789Z INFO IntakeService - Recorded intake intake-uuid-321 for reminder rmd-uuid-789

6. Database output examples:
- A `Reminders` row with `status=TRIGGERED`, `scheduled_time=2025-12-22T08:00:00+05:30`, `triggered_at=2025-12-22T08:00:00.123Z`.
- A corresponding `IntakeHistory` row with `status=TAKEN` and a timestamp of the user's confirmation.
- `NotificationLog` entries showing delivery attempts and responses.

7. API outputs (representative):
- Create medicine (201 Created) returns medicine id and `nextRun` timestamp.
- Confirm intake (200 OK) returns the created intake entry with an `intakeId`.
- Get history (200 OK) returns a paginated list of intake records.

8. Acceptance criteria verification:
- All primary user flows produce the expected outputs as demonstrated in the sample input/output file.
- Scheduler produces logs for each triggered reminder and notification delivery attempts are recorded.
- The history lists reflect user confirmations accurately and are filterable by date range.

9. Export and reporting output:
- Simple CSV export of history where each row contains: timestamp, medicine name, dose, status, note.
- Summary report showing adherence percentage (taken / scheduled) for a selected period.

10. Packaging final output for submission:
- Include sample screenshots, surefire test reports, and a database dump (or generated sample data) with the project submission so evaluators can reproduce outputs.

11. Troubleshooting tips for reviewers:
- If reminders do not appear, ensure the scheduler is running and `Schedules.next_run` is populated in the database.
- Check WebSocket connectivity in the browser console and verify backend logs for notification delivery.

12. Conclusion:
The final output of DoseMate demonstrates a working medication reminder system with clear UI outputs, reliable backend logging, and persistent history records. These outputs collectively satisfy the functional and non-functional requirements specified earlier in the documentation.
