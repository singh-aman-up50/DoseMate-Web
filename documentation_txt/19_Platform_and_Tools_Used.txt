Platform and Tools Used

1. Overview:
This project uses a modern web development toolchain: React for the frontend, Vite as the build tool, and Spring Boot for the backend, with a relational database for persistence. The choice of tools balances developer productivity and demonstration of industry-standard technologies.

2. Frontend tools and libraries:
- React: UI library for building component-based interfaces.
- Vite: Development server and bundler for faster builds and HMR (hot module replacement).
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for fast, responsive styling.
- Axios: Promise-based HTTP client used for API calls.
- React Router: Client-side routing for single-page application behavior.

3. Backend tools and libraries:
- Java 11+ (or compatible JVM): Language and runtime for backend.
- Spring Boot: Rapid backend framework for building RESTful APIs and WebSocket endpoints.
- Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database access and repositories.
- H2 (development) / PostgreSQL (production): Relational databases for persistence.
- Maven: Build and dependency management tool for Java.

4. Development tools:
- Node.js and npm/yarn: For managing frontend packages and scripts.
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code: Recommended IDEs for Java and JavaScript development.
- Git: Version control for source code management.

5. Testing tools:
- JUnit for backend unit/integration tests.
- React Testing Library / Jest for frontend unit tests.
- Postman or curl for manual API testing.

6. Optional infrastructure/tools for production:
- Docker: Containerize backend and frontend for deployment and reproducibility.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or similar for automated builds and tests.
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana or cloud monitoring for production health checks.

7. Rationale for tool selection:
- React + Vite offers a fast development loop and modern frontend patterns.
- Spring Boot is widely used in enterprise and academic settings, making it ideal for demonstrating server-side principles.
- Tailwind CSS enables quick styling without complex CSS architecture.

8. Version and compatibility notes:
- Use Node 16+ for compatibility with Vite and modern packages.
- Use Java 11 or later for Spring Boot compatibility.
- Keep Maven dependencies aligned with Spring Boot version to avoid mismatches.

9. Installation quick commands (setup summary):
- Frontend:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
- Backend:
  - `mvn clean install`
  - `mvn spring-boot:run`

10. Conclusion:
The selected platforms and tools support a robust and modern full-stack application suitable for academic demonstration and straightforward to extend for production scenarios.
