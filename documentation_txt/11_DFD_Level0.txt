Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Level 0 — Context Diagram

1. Purpose:
DFD Level 0 (context diagram) shows the system as a single process and its interaction with external entities such as Users and External Notification Services.

2. External entities:
- User: The primary actor interacting with the system through the frontend.
- Caregiver: Optional actor who may access a user's history with permission.
- Notification Provider: External service for push/SMS (optional integration).

3. Single process:
- Process 0: DoseMate System — handles user management, scheduling, reminders, intake logging, and reporting.

4. Data flows:
- From User to DoseMate: Registration details, medicine data, schedule configurations, intake confirmations.
- From DoseMate to User: Reminder notifications, history views, profile updates.
- From DoseMate to Notification Provider: Notification payloads (for external delivery) and delivery status reports back to DoseMate.

5. Data stores (external to the Level 0 diagram but important to note):
- Database: stores users, medicines, schedules, reminders, history.

6. High-level description:
- The context diagram illustrates that DoseMate mediates communication between the user and persistent storage, and optionally forwards notifications to external providers.

7. Notation suggestions:
- Process 0: circle or rounded rectangle labeled "DoseMate System".
- Entities: rectangles for User, Caregiver, Notification Provider.
- Data stores: labeled cylinder representing persistent database (shown on next levels).

8. Key responsibilities captured:
- User-facing operations (add/edit medicines, schedule, confirm intake)
- Background operations (scheduling engine, notifications)
- Data persistence and reporting

9. Practical usage for documentation:
- Include the Level 0 DFD image in your printed documentation and explain each arrow representing the data flows.

10. Conclusion:
The DFD Level 0 provides a clear, simple overview of how DoseMate interacts with outside entities and encapsulates the main system boundaries for further decomposition in Level 1 and beyond.
