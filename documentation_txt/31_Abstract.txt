Abstract

DoseMate is a web-based medication reminder and intake-tracking system developed to improve medication adherence among patients, caregivers, and elderly users. The application combines a user-friendly React frontend with a robust Spring Boot backend to provide secure user management, flexible medication scheduling, timely reminders, and a persistent intake history. The system addresses common causes of non-adherence—forgetfulness, complex regimens, and lack of monitoring—by centralizing medication data, automating notifications, and creating an auditable record of doses taken or missed.

The project begins by establishing clear functional requirements: secure authentication, medicine CRUD operations, flexible scheduling patterns (daily, interval-based, and one-time reminders), a reliable reminder engine, intake logging, and reporting. Non-functional requirements focus on usability (responsive UI and accessibility), reliability (durable scheduling and reconciliation), security (hashed passwords and TLS), and maintainability (modular architecture and clear documentation). A feasibility study confirms that the chosen technologies—React, Vite, Spring Boot, and a relational database—are appropriate for an academic prototype and can be extended for production use.

System design separates concerns across presentation, service, persistence, and notification layers. The frontend implements accessible components and context providers for authentication and theme management, while the backend exposes RESTful APIs and WebSocket endpoints for real-time notifications. The persistence layer models core entities—User, Medicine, Schedule, Reminder, IntakeHistory, NotificationLog—ensuring referential integrity and efficient querying for scheduler operations and reporting. The scheduler computes next-run times using timezone-aware APIs, registers triggers, logs deliveries, and supports reconciliation jobs to handle missed or delayed confirmations.

Implementation details cover the choice of frameworks, code organization, and critical patterns: DTOs to decouple API contracts from domain models, repository patterns using Spring Data JPA, and adapter-style notification interfaces that permit future integration with external push or SMS services. The frontend centralizes API access through an axios instance with auth token handling and uses WebSocket for instant reminder delivery. Error handling is centralized with standardized API error responses, and resilient scheduling logic is complemented by reconciliation routines for reliability.

Testing demonstrates the system's functional correctness and stability. Unit tests validate scheduling logic and input validation; integration tests verify end-to-end API flows; manual and optional automated end-to-end tests confirm UI interactions, reminder triggering, and intake recording. Key bugs were identified and fixed—examples include timezone miscalculations and race conditions during schedule updates—illustrating the importance of timezone-aware computation and transactional safeguards. Test artifacts include unit test reports, integration test results, and sample logs capturing scheduled triggers and intake events.

The final output showcases a usable dashboard that surfaces upcoming reminders, interactive confirmation controls, a history page with filtering and export capabilities, and backend logs demonstrating reminder triggers and notification delivery attempts. The project documents include UML diagrams (use case, class, activity, state), DFD artifacts across multiple levels, ER diagrams for database design, code snippets explaining core operations, and detailed instructions for running the frontend and backend locally.

Limitations of the current prototype are noted: optional external notification integrations (SMS/push) may be mocked rather than fully implemented, large-scale performance and production hardening (distributed scheduling, monitoring, backups) require further work, and formal regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA) is outside the immediate scope. The future development roadmap prioritizes adding persistent job queues, multi-channel notifications, caregiver dashboards, mobile apps with offline support, analytics, and interoperability with clinical systems using standards like FHIR.

In conclusion, DoseMate provides a coherent, well-documented academic demonstration of a medication reminder system. It combines practical engineering with clear design rationale and testing evidence, forming a solid basis for grading and for potential future expansion into a production-quality digital health product. The provided documentation and codebase enable reviewers to reproduce the system, validate core behaviors, and extend features as required.
